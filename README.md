# Project Technical Highlights

## 1. Frontend Frameworks and Libraries
- **Vue.js**: According to the provided GitHub repository information, this site uses Vue.js as the primary frontend framework.
- **Vite**: Used for development and build tooling, providing fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized build outputs.

## 2. HTTPS Secure Transmission and SSL Certificate Management
- **Automatic SSL Certificates**: Vercel automatically provides free SSL certificates for all custom domains, simplifying the setup process for HTTPS.
- **Forced HTTPS Redirect**: Can easily implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection via the `vercel.json` configuration file.

## 3. Frontend Performance Optimization and Resource Management
- **CDN Acceleration**: Vercel’s global CDN automatically distributes static resources, reducing load times and improving user experience.
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Use `Cache-Control` and `ETag` headers to manage browser caching.
  - Leverage Vercel’s edge network caching capabilities to further optimize static resource loading speeds.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for images or resources using HTML5’s `loading="lazy"` attribute to improve initial load performance.

## 4. Backend Architecture and Real-Time Communication
- **API Calls**: Although primarily used for frontend deployment, Vercel can integrate API gateways or serverless functions (such as AWS Lambda or Vercel’s own Serverless Functions) to handle dynamic data requests.
- **WebSocket Support**: If WebSocket support is needed, additional services (like Upstash Redis or third-party services) are typically required since Vercel does not natively support WebSockets.

## 5. Development Debugging and Security Enhancements
- **Development Environment**: Use Vite’s development server for local development, allowing rapid iteration and testing of new features.
- **Security Enhancements**: Utilize Vercel’s built-in security features (such as automatic HTTPS and DDoS protection) along with input validation and token verification mechanisms in frontend code to secure the application.

## 6. Server Operations and Monitoring
- **Vercel Dashboard**: Provides detailed deployment logs, performance metrics, and error tracking, assisting developers in monitoring application status.
- **Seamless Scaling**: Thanks to Vercel’s serverless architecture, applications can scale automatically based on traffic without manual intervention.

## Deployment

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build
Method One: Using npm to Install pnpm (Recommended)
If you have Node.js installed (which includes npm), you can install pnpm with:

bash
深色版本
npm install -g pnpm

After installation, run:

```bash
pnpm install
Method Two: Using Corepack with pnpm (For Node.js 16+)
Enable Corepack:

bash
深色版本
corepack enable

Then try installing dependencies again:

```bash
pnpm install

If Corepack is unavailable, update Node.js to v16 or higher.

### Method Three: Verify pnpm Installation
After installing pnpm, verify the installation with:

```bash
pnpm --version

If a version number is displayed, the installation was successful.

#### Troubleshooting Deployment Issues
##### Issue 1: pnpm command not found / not an internal or external command
**Possible Causes**:
- pnpm not correctly installed.
- Not added to system environment variables.
- Incorrect command line tool usage (e.g., cmd, PowerShell, bash paths differ).

**Resolution Steps**:

Confirm if pnpm is globally installed:

```bash
pnpm --version

If the command does not exist, reinstall:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm

Check if Node.js and npm are installed:

```bash
node --version
npm --version

If not installed, download and install the LTS version from the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

Ensure “Add Node.js to PATH” option is selected during installation on Windows systems. Alternatively, manually add `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\npm` to the system environment variable PATH.

Try using `npx pnpm install` temporarily (not recommended for long-term use).

##### Issue 2: corepack enable command not found
**Possible Cause**: Current Node.js version is below v16, while Corepack is introduced starting from Node.js v16.

**Resolution Steps**:

Check Node.js version:

```bash
node --version

If below v16.x, upgrade Node.js to the latest LTS version using nvm (Windows) or nvm.sh (macOS/Linux). Alternatively, uninstall the old version and download/install the latest version from the official website.

Enable Corepack:

```bash
corepack enable

### Vercel Deployment
Now supports one-click deployment via Vercel without needing a server.

>Note: Modify the API address in environment variables.

User Guide for "Today's Hotlist"
1. Feature Modules
1. Multi-source Content Aggregation
The system integrates real-time trending data from multiple mainstream content platforms. A backend crawler scheduler fetches and caches data periodically, while the frontend retrieves and displays it via unified RESTful APIs. Supported platforms include (but are not limited to):

Bilibili – Popular videos, trending discussions, and user interactions;

Weibo – Hot search keywords and trending hashtags;

Douyin (TikTok China) – Popular short video topics;

Zhihu – High-traffic Q&A threads (with built-in error handling);

Others – Including Baidu Hot Search, 36Kr Flash News, Xiaohongshu, ITHome, and Sspai.

2. Live Refresh Logic
Each module includes a timestamp indicating the last update time. Data is refreshed via both automatic and manual triggers:

The backend uses scheduled cron jobs to refresh cached content every 10 minutes;

The frontend allows users to manually trigger a forced HTTP request to refresh UI content via the refresh button.

3. UI Controls

🔄 Manual Refresh – Sends an immediate request to update all modules;

🌙/☀️ Theme Toggle – Switch between light and dark modes; preferences are stored via localStorage;

⚙️ Settings Panel – Open the configuration menu to toggle visibility of each content module;

🔁 Retry Mechanism – If a data fetch fails, the corresponding module will show a fallback error card with a retry button to re-trigger the API request.

2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q1: Why does a module show "Failed to Load"?
A: Possible causes include:

Target platform's page structure (HTML/JSON) has changed;

Network issues (e.g. timeouts, DNS errors);

IP or user-agent blocks.
Troubleshooting Tips:

Check your internet connection;

Click the “Retry” button in the failed module;

Open the browser console (F12) for detailed logs and report errors if necessary.

Q2: The content hasn’t updated for a long time — what should I do?
A:

Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to bypass browser caching;

The server may still be within its cache window (e.g., last 10-minute interval);

Enable “Developer Mode” in settings to inspect raw API timestamps per module.

Q3: Why is the "x minutes ago" time incorrect?
A: The timestamp is calculated using the browser’s local Date.now(). If your system time is incorrect, the relative time display will be inaccurate. Please sync your system clock.

Q4: Can I click on keywords to view the original source?
A: Some platforms (e.g., Weibo, Zhihu) support outbound links. This feature can be enabled via the "Link Redirect" option in Settings. Others may not support it due to anti-scraping protection or missing URLs in source data.

3. Best Practices
✅ Check the hotlist during peak periods (e.g., 7–9 AM, 12–1 PM) to capture trending topics efficiently;

✅ Temporarily disable unstable modules in Settings if they frequently fail to load, which helps performance;

✅ Use a modern browser (Chrome 90+, Edge, Firefox) to ensure compatibility and smooth experience;

✅ For embedding use cases, wrap the application as an iframe or extract components for modular use;

✅ Use the Feedback button in Settings to report bugs or suggest new feature enhancements.
